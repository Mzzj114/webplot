# Network Graph Editor

A tool for organizing ideas, featuring nodes that support rich text. This project aims to create an intuitive and visually appealing editor for network graphs.

## Features

- **Rich Text Nodes**: Each node in the graph can contain rich text, allowing for detailed and flexible content.
- **Customizable Design**: Nodes can be styled to look like sticky notes, with features like pushpins for added aesthetics.
- **Interactive Editing**: Right-click menus for nodes and the canvas make editing seamless.
- **Advanced Visuals**: Uses [AntV G6](https://g6.antv.antgroup.com/) for rendering high-quality topology graphs.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML (using Layui)
- **Application Framework**: pywebView
