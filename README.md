# Webplot

A tool for organizing ideas, featuring nodes that support rich text. This project aims to create an intuitive and visually appealing editor for network graphs.
This project is a work in progress and serves as a personal tool for idea organization. Its features aim to make graph-based thinking and planning more intuitive and visually engaging.
It is much simpler and easy to use compare to other products in making mind maps or other network diagrams.

## Features

- **Rich Text Nodes**: Each node in the graph can contain rich text, allowing for detailed and flexible content.
- **Customizable Design**: Nodes can be styled to look like sticky notes, with features like pushpins for added aesthetics.
- **Interactive Editing**: Right-click menus for nodes and the canvas make editing seamless.
- **Advanced Visuals**: Uses [AntV G6](https://g6.antv.antgroup.com/) for rendering high-quality topology graphs.

## Usage
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your device.
2. **Dependencies**: Install the necessary Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Run**: Run `python main.py` to start the application.

The executable file built with Pyinstaller is on progress.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML (using [Layui](https://github.com/layui/layui))
- **Application Framework**: [pywebView](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview)
